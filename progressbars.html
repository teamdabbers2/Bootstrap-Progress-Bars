<!--the code below shows a simple way on how to make a progress bar-->
<!-- we start with a container class and then include a progress class along with a contextual progress-bar class. After
this, we then need the style of the progress bar which equals width:40% in quotes-->
<!-- here, inside the width what we are doing is that we are indicating how much of the bar we want filled.
This is from 0 to 100 percent and whatever percent you put after the width is how much the bar will fill-->

    <div class="progress-bar" style="width:40%"></div>
